            <h2>My Favorite Animals</h2>
                <p> My favorite domestic animals are cats.
                    I think they are some of the best pets.
                    Another one of my favorite pets to own
                    is beared dragon.  I owned one when I was
                    younger and he was the best.  
                </p>

                <p> The animals I like that are not common
                    pets would be racoons and deer.  Racoons
                    just look cool and deer are super pretty
                    I love seeing baby deer when im riding in
                    the woods.

            <h2>My Music Taste</h2>
                <p> I listen to plenty of genres.  Jazz is 
                    one of my main ones.  I like a lot of old
                    artists like Nat King Cole, Betty Hutton, 
                    Etta James, stuff like that.  But I also like Lana
                    Del Rey a lot.  Its funny because it is so wildly 
                    different. My favorite lana albums in order would be:
                </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Did You Know That Theres a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd?</li>
                        <li>Blue Banisters</li>
                        <li>Lana Del Ray</li>
                        <li>Born to Die</li>
                        <li>NFR</li>
                    </ol>
                
                <p> 
                    She has more albums but I don't listen to them in whole like I do these five.
