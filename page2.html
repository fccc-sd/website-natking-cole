            <h2> My Pets </h2>
                <p> I have six pets that I love very much. 
                    Four of the animals are dogs, the other two
                    are cats.  My animals names are:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Sammy (dog)</li>
                    <li>Joy (dog)</li>
                    <li>Harley(dog)</li>
                    <li>Gunner(dog)</li>
                    <li>Jinx(cat)</li>
                    <li>Jax(cat)</li>
                </ul>

                <p> We have had Sammy as long as I remember.
                    Harley and Joy are her babies.  Mom let both 
                    me and Grace keep one of the puppies.  Joy is 
                    my dog and Harley is hers.  Gunner is Sammy's grandson.
                    One of the puppies we gave away had him.  We drove all 
                    the way to virginia to get him.  We chose him because he
                    looked identical to Sammy. My cats are both strays.
                    I actually just hid Jinx from dad until he heard him meow
                    and Mom and I begged dad to keep him.  He did.  Same happened with
                    Jax except I didn't hide him.  Now he adores those cats and cuddles
                    with them.

            <h2>My Favorite books</h2>
                <p> I've always enjoyed reading.  Especially classics.
                    Most of my favorite books are classical books.
                    I really like George Orwell.  Animal farm and 1984
                    were mindblowing books to me when I first read them.
                    The saddest book I ever read was Lolita.  I bawled
                    my eyes out for hours after I finished the book.
                    It was insanely disturbing but so well thought out.
                    You go the entire story knowing she was doomed from the start
                    and that the story you are reading is warped through the eyes
                    of a maniac.  She never gets to tell her side of the story.
                    I also love the Interview With The Vampire series.  I've read
                    all the books, watched the first movie, and watched the series.
                    The series is wildly different from the book but they managed to make
                    the plot even more deep and still keep the same essence of the books.

            <h2>My Future Plans</h2>
                <p> I plan on going to Northwest after highschool and
                    getting an associates.  After that I will hopefully
                    go to a bigger school like Trine or Toledo.  My brother
                    went to Trine, but engineering wasn't for him.  My dream job
                    is actually to be in the pit orchestras that travel the US 
                    with broadway shows.  That would be a dream come true.  However, 
                    music doesn't pay well and it's an extremely hard life to get into.
                    You have to be very well experienced in multiple instruments
                    since the style of the music and skill level changes with every show.
                    Even though I most likely won't get to do this as a job, I am still
                    going to involve myself in music the rest of my life through city  bands
                    parades, ect.  It will forever be one of my favorite hobbies.
