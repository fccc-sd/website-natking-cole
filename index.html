    <h2> My Hobbies</h2>

            <p>
                I have plenty of small hobbies.  However, my main interests are mostly music related. 
                I enjoy collecting vinyl records.  I usually get them from the local record store or an
                antique shop near me that sells bundles of them.  My collection isn't left to sit around, 
                I use my records even if they are limited edition. Why buy them just to stare at them? 
                My collection has plenty of Nat King Cole.  He is by far my favorite artist. 
                A close second would be The Moody Blues.  I haven't heard a bad song from them yet.  
                I collect a lot of music from the 20s-70s.  Lesley Gore, Bernadette Carol, Ricky Nelson,
                The Ronettes, surprisingly no Elvis.

            <p>
                I also enjoy reading comic books.  I know plenty about Batman.  I used to collect comic
                books but they are so <em>expensive,</em> I read them online now.  I play alot of batman video 
                games aswell.  Batman: Arkham Origins and Telltale Batman are my two favorites. 
                I play other video games but I prefer storygames.  Batman is the perfect game for those.
                Some of my favorite comics are:

    <h2>My Family</h2>  
          <!--I dont live with all 4 of my siblings. Only Grace lives with me.-->
        
            <p>
                I am the 4th child of my parents.  I have four other siblings.  2 girls and 2 boys.  
                My siblings names, from oldest to youngest, are:
               
           
            </p>

                 <ol>
                    <li>Cody</li>
                    <li>Jacob</li>
                    <li>Sydney</li>
                    <li>Me</li>
                    <li>Grace</li>
                </ol>

            <p>
                I love my family above all else.  My brother actually just got engaged to his girlfriend, Kat.
                She's the best. My mom is a mental health worker and my father drives truck.  He takes me with him 
                on his trips during the summer and on weekends.  My mother also was a lab tech, a very talented one.
                However she prefers her new job.  My sister is annoying but I can't imagine growing up without her.

    <h2>What I do in my Free Time</h2>
        <!--I plan on learning as many instruments as I can-->
            <p>
                I enjoy practicing instruments.  I have played clarinet for 7 years now.  I enjoy clarinet
                alot.  Playing it in marching band is the highlight of my year.  When I get home, I try and play my piano,
                (<em>which is actually just a keyboard,</em>) atleast half an hour a day.  However, I work as a cook at a bar
                in Antwerp, and usually I only have an hour or two at home before I go in for my shift.  I also took guitar class 
                and can play chords and tabs, however I cannot do bar chords, and strum patterns are a bit difficult sometimes.
            </p>

            <p>
                When im not playing music or working, I like to spend my time riding on the trails in our woods with dirtbikes and 
                our side-by-side.  My sister and I spend hours out there sometimes.  We have beautiful trails and would go out 
                afterschool and come back at 10pm.  We've put almost a thousand miles on the side-by-side.
